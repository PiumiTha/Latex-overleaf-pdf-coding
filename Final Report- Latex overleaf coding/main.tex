\subsubsection{TRADITIONAL DIRECT TPMS}\label{traditional-direct-tpms}}

\begin{quote}
The Traditional Direct TPMS employs a methodology wherein pressure
sensors situated within each tire wirelessly transmit data to a central
receiver located in the vehicle. This system utilizes piezoelectric
pressure sensors and radio frequency (RF) communication technology,
enabling highly accurate and real-time monitoring of tire pressure,
along with individual tire identification capabilities. Despite its
strengths in providing precise data, the Traditional Direct TPMS has
notable weaknesses, including relatively high costs, the need for
installation, and periodic battery replacements. Furthermore, it is
susceptible to signal interference. Insights from recent literature
highlight ongoing research efforts focused on optimizing sensor size and
power consumption, refining communication protocols, and incorporating
additional diagnostics such as temperature and tread wear into the
system for a more comprehensive monitoring approach.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{indirect-tpms}{%
\subsubsection{INDIRECT TPMS}\label{indirect-tpms}}

\begin{quote}
Indirect TPMS operates by utilizing the existing Anti-lock Braking
System (ABS) sensors to monitor variations in wheel rotation speed,
indirectly deducing changes in tire pressure. This system relies on the
technology of existing ABS sensors and involves the analysis of wheel
speed data. Notably, its strengths lie in being a cost-effective
solution that requires no installation or ongoing maintenance, and it
remains operational even in the presence of flat tires. However, it
comes with inherent weaknesses, including lower accuracy in comparison
to direct TPMS, an inability to identify individual tire pressure
issues, and susceptibility to external factors such as road conditions.
Current literature insights in this domain focus on developing
algorithms to enhance pressure estimation accuracy, integrating
additional sensors like accelerometers into the system, and exploring
ways to integrate Indirect TPMS with traditional TPMS for a more
comprehensive and reliable tire monitoring approach.

\begin{quote}
In this methodology, the initial step involves the utilization of the
BMP180 pressure sensor to measure both the pressure and temperature
within the tire. This sensor gathers accurate data reflecting the
internal conditions of the tire {[}1{]}. Subsequently, the gathered
pressure and temperature values are transmitted to the ESP32
microcontroller, which acts as the central processing unit for the
system {[}3{]}.

The ESP32, equipped with Wi-Fi capabilities, facilitates the wireless
transmission of these values to an LED display. This real-time display
allows users to monitor the current pressure and temperature status of
the tire conveniently. The system is designed with a safety feature
wherein if the measured values decrease beyond a predetermined
threshold, indicating a potential leak in the tire, the ESP32 triggers
an indication mechanism.

This alert will be visual through and LED light, to promptly notify the
user of the tire\textquotesingle s compromised condition, enabling
timely intervention and maintenance. In essence, this integrated system
offers a comprehensive solution for monitoring tire pressure and
temperature, ensuring user awareness and enhancing overall vehicle

specific wiring will depend on the type of sensor you are using (analog
or digital).Connect any additional components, such as a display unit or
power supply. Ensure that the power supply can provide sufficient power
for both the ESP32 and the tire pressure sensors. Write code to read
data from each tire pressure sensor. This may involve using analog or
digital pins on the ESP32, depending on the sensor type. Convert the
sensor readings to actual pressure values using the
sensor\textquotesingle s specifications. Implement code to transmit the
tire pressure data wirelessly using the ESP32\textquotesingle s Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth capabilities. For Wi-Fi communication, you might consider
setting up a simple web server on the ESP32 to serve the tire pressure
data. If using a display unit, write code to display the tire pressure
data. This could be an LCD display connected to the ESP32. Test the
system by deploying it on a vehicle and monitoring the tire pressure
readings. Calibrate the system if necessary to ensure accurate pressure
readings. Ensure that the system does not interfere with the normal
operation of the vehicle. Implement safety features to handle any
failures or errors gracefully. Document the system, including the
hardware and software components, wiring diagrams, and any calibration
procedures.
